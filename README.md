# netlink-hs

This is library provides utility to use netlink from haskell.

All `Constants.hs` files are generated by scripts, so they are not documented or look nice.

The scope of this package extends over general netlink support to specific implementations of netlink families.

I mainly add functionality when I need it, so depending on whether I used it before and how big it is, 
there is varying support for netlink based protocols.

Some families may be supported more indepth than others. The GeNetlinks control familiy for example is 
nearly 100% supported, nl80211 is somewhat supported and others are completely missing.

Feel free to create issues for new features if you need some.
